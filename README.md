Insurance is a policy that reduces or eliminates the expenses associated with decreasing returns brought on by various risks. The price of insurance is influenced by a number of factors.

The efficiency of insurance policy termsin the insurance industry can be enhanced using machine learning 
(ML).

To compare the effectiveness of these algorithms, XGBoost Regression, Lasso Regression, Random 

Forest Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision Tree Regression, KNN Model, Support Vector 

Regression, and Gradient Boosting Regression-were utilized.

The model wasthen put to the test and confirmed by contrasting the actual data with what was predicted to be abundant. These models' accuracy was compared subsequently.

Key Words: Healthcare, Insurance; Regression, Machine Learning, Prediction, Data analysis.
